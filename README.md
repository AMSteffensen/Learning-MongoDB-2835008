Excelling in an ever-changing software development world requires true "full stack" experience. Knowledge of nonrelational databases in particular adds exciting new capabilities and features that make everyday development easier, more streamlined, and vastly more scalable. This course provides an introduction to using MongoDB, one of the most popular nonrelational databases. Discover how to create documents to store data, organize documents in collections, and write queries to read, update, and delete documents. Instructor Justin Jenkins also shows how to properly index data to increase performance in MongoDB, and then shows how MongoDB can be integrated with applications written in Python, Node.js, and PHP. In the final chapter, he covers basic server administration, including replication, sharding, security, and backups. Make sure to practice your newfound MongoDB skills using the challenge and solution sets issued along the way.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
